### 1. the <font color=red>biological mechanism</font> underlying most of the GWAS hits explaining the association with the phenotype remains unknown, which hinders translation to clinical medicine.

### 2.  Since the <font color=red>explained variance</font> by common SNPs for most phenotypes is limited so far, they are not useful in predictive medicine and this also limits their application in Mendelian randomization studies

### 3.  the number of SNPs that is actually <font color=red>genotyped </font>which usually represents 0.3 to 0.5% of all variant nucleotides in the human genome. Although this number is slightly higher for imputed datasets, it remains an underrepresentation of all variant nucleotides in a human genome
