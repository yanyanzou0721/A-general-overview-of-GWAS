### cheaper , bigger 

### *1*. the introduction of <font color=green>relatively inexpensive SNP arrays</font>, such as the UK Biobank array from Affymetrix and the GSA array from Illumina, a new wave of very large-scale datasets has been generated, including the UK Biobank dataset（500,000） 、the U.S.veterans dataset（1,000,000）

### *2*. <font color=green>NGS technology</font> . whole exome sequencing (WES) which provides all nucleotide variation in the coding part of the genome ; whole genome sequence (WGS) data that covers >95% of all nucleotides.
